## 📖 How It Works

### AI Reasoning Framework

The system uses a proven 5-step reasoning framework to analyze each email:

1. **Sender Analysis** 👤 - Identifies real people vs automated systems vs marketing
2. **Content Analysis** 📝 - Detects questions, requests, and calls to action
3. **Urgency Analysis** ⚡ - Assesses time-sensitivity and importance
4. **Spam/Marketing Filter** 🚫 - Filters promotional content and newsletters
5. **Business Context** 💼 - Distinguishes work-related vs personal emails

### Email Classification

**Responds to:**
- ✅ Direct questions from colleagues or clients
- ✅ Meeting requests and scheduling inquiries
- ✅ Work assignments and project communications
- ✅ Personal messages from known contacts

**Ignores:**
- ❌ Marketing and promotional emails
- ❌ Newsletters and automated notifications
- ❌ Spam and junk mail
- ❌ Social media notifications

## 📊 Usage Example

```
Getting unread emails...

Analyzing: Project Update Meeting Request...
Type: business
Needs response: true
Priority: high
Reasoning: Contains meeting request from colleague, requires scheduling
✅ Draft response created
Meeting scheduled for January 15, 2024 at 2:00 PM. Calendar invite sent!

Analyzing: Newsletter: Weekly Tech Updates...
Type: newsletter
Needs response: false
Skipped: Automated newsletter, no response needed

Done! Created 1 draft responses and 1 meetings.
```

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy

- **Local Processing**: All email analysis happens locally on your machine
- **Secure Authentication**: Uses Google OAuth 2.0 for secure API access
- **Minimal Permissions**: Only requests necessary Gmail and Calendar permissions
- **No Data Storage**: Doesn't store or log your email content
- **Draft Only**: Creates drafts for your review, never sends automatically

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"OpenAI API key not found"**
- Ensure your `.env` file contains `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_key`

**"credentials.json not found"**
- Download OAuth credentials from Google Cloud Console
- Ensure file is named exactly `credentials.json`

**"Permission denied" errors**
- Re-run the OAuth flow by deleting token files:
  ```bash
  rm gmail_token.json calendar_token.json
  python smart_email_responder.py
  ```
